System Reference Prompt

I’m building a beauty product website called Her Choice PH using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with these files:

pageMain.html (landing page)

styles.css (styling, based on provided design system)

sys.js (main logic and interactivity)

cart.html (cart and checkout page)

admin.html (admin dashboard)

System Flow

Customer Experience

Enters landing page with scrollable UI.

Sticky header with buttons: Shop scrolls to product section, About scrolls to brand section, Contact scrolls to footer.

Can add one product set (changeable) + two extra products.

On add-to-cart, a 2-second bottom popup shows “Undo action?”.

Cart page allows editing sets and removing extras.

Checkout form collects full name, address, Facebook, email, phone, and payment method.

On order submit, a popup confirms that the order is queued; customer is later contacted via email/phone for confirmation.

Admin Experience

Enters a special admin link/page.

Logs in with account + password, verified via Gmail.

Dashboard shows orders and product stocks.

Stocks auto-update when orders are confirmed.

Optionally, customers get free email/SMS notifications when admin inputs expected delivery details.

Confirmed orders are queued into the Deliveries board.

GCash orders are auto-confirmed and prioritized in delivery.

Customer comments auto-list; admin can “pop” and move verified comments to the top.

Admin manually contacts customers via Messenger; fallback is phone/email.
